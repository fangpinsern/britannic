- Nodejs
- Express
- Mongo DB

Prerequisites:

1. Have node installed in your computer. For the latest version of node, go to https://nodejs.org/en/
2. To check if you have nodejs installed, type in terminal "node --version". If they show you the version number, you have node installed. If you use windows, idk alr. You got to figure it out.
3. Node comes with npm installed usually. Npm is a package manager that helps you manage the packages you use in your node projects. To check if that is installed, type "npm --version" in your terminal. If the version number shows up, then you have it already.
4. Have Git installed in your computer. To download it, pls google how to do it by searching "How to install git on [insert your operating system]"
5. To check if git is installed, type in your terminal "git --version". For mac users, doing this will automatically install git. If you dont have it. #macisthebest

TLDR: Have node, npm and git

Get Started:

Find a nice place in your computer to store the source code. Preferably somewhere you will remember. After that, navigate to your file in the terminal. Then, type in your terminal "git clone <https://github.com/keviiweb/backend.git>".

The repository should be cloned into your computer by now. Yay.

Alternatively, you could download it I guess. But I never do that before so I cannot help you there. Feel free to update this if you did it and want to help out.

To start the app, you need to do the following:

1. npm i
2. npm start

Voila. Your app has started. By default it runs on localhost:8080

To test if it is working, go to postman or your browser and type in "localhost:8080/ping". It should say "You have successfully connected to the server".

Nice... Now the hard part... Actually coding. Have fun :)

TLDR: clone the repo, npm i, npm start

Rules:

1. ALWAYS create a new branch when developing
2. DONT commit or push to master
3. NEVER commit or push .env file.
4. When in doubt ask :)
